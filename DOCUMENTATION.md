# WGUPS ROUTING PROGRAM

#### The following is a detailed outline of the rubric requirements for this project

## A: Algorithm Selection

This program utilizes the 2-opt search algorithm to try and find the shortest path between addresses.
The 2-opt algorithm tries to organize a route so that it does not cross over itself, which in turn
can find an optimal path. The 2-opt algorithm runs in `O(n^2)` similar to the NN algorithm but to me 
it seems like a more elegant solution to this problem. My goal was to keep my runtime around
`O(n^2)` otherwise, I could've chosen the 3-opt algorithm which runs in `O(n^3)`.

code for my 2-opt is in `delivery_process.py @ line 221`

## B1: Logic Comments
The following explanation describes the process of how my program solves this problem:

#### Outline of Problem:
```text
The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine the best route and delivery distribution for 
their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised 
deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver 
each day; each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.

Your task is to determine the best algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages, listed in the 
attached “WGUPS Package File,” will be delivered on time with the least number of miles added to the combined mileage 
total of all trucks. The specific delivery locations are shown on the attached “Salt Lake City Downtown Map” and 
distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.”

While you work on this assessment, take into consideration the specific delivery time expected for each package and 
the possibility that the delivery requirements—including the expected delivery time—can be changed by management at 
any time and at any point along the chosen route. In addition, you should keep in mind that the supervisor should be 
able to see, at assigned points, the progress of each truck and its packages by any of the variables listed in the 
“WGUPS Package File,” including what has been delivered and what time the delivery occurred.

The intent is to use this solution (program) for this specific location and to use the same program in many cities 
in each state where WGU has a presence. As such, you will need to include detailed comments, following the 
industry-standard Python style guide, to make your code easy to read and to justify the decisions you made while 
writing your program.
```

### Solution Explanation

##### Load/store package data given to us in an excel/csv format
- Read the csv file to parse each data row.
- Take those parsed rows and create a package object.
- Store those package objects into a hash table.

##### Load/store distance data given to us in an excel/csv format
- Read the csv file to parse each data row.
- Clean the parsed data so that it is usable.
- Store the data so that it is easily iterable/retrievable.

##### Run the main program that delivers the packages 
- A call to the `deliver_packages()` function will instantiate three truck objects. Then using those truck objects and the
 package data the program will sort the packages into trucks 1, 2, and 3. 
- While trucks are sorted with packages, address list are created and stored with which addresses will need 
to be visited with a certain truck.
- Once the trucks are loaded with packages and each truck has a list of addresses to visit then the address lists are sorted
to find the optimal path.
- To optimize the addresses each list is passed into the `optimize()` function that will look at each address and
iteratively run a 2-opt swap then compare the distance total to the previous version of the route. If the new version 
is shorter then the previous version then that becomes the best route. The 2-opt swap essentially swaps every address with every other address until
an optimal route is found.
- Each time a route is 2-opt swapped it is run through the `cost()` function which totals the distance to visit each address
in the given address list starting at index 0.

#### Command line interface (CLI)
- The rest of the program utilizes a CLI so that end users can do the following things:
- insert a package into the hash table
- look up a package by id
- look up a package by id and time
- see details of all packages

#### 2-Opt algorithm overview:
The basis for the 2-opt algorithm is as follows:
- initiate a random list of nodes and assign as the optimal route
- from the starting node + 1 (i) for the length of nodes to end - 1
- then from start node + 2 (k) for the length of nodes
- create a new route by making a copy of the optimal route then swap nodes from i to k
- on each route count the cost to travel from node to node starting at the first node
- if the new route cost is less than the current optimal route assign optimal route to new route 
- repeat until the routes can no longer be optimized

The 2-opt algorithm on its own not considering the function to calculate cost for each route will run 
in `O(n^2)`. Depending on how the cost function is designed the minimum speed would be `O(n^2)`.

Below is the pseudocode for the 2-opt algorithm:

```text
two_opt_swap(route, i, k)
    new_route = route
    new_route from i to k = route from k-1 to i-1
    return new_route
```

```text
optimal_route(list_of_nodes)
    optimal_route = list_of_nodes
    while no improvements
        for i=1 to i list_of_nodes - 1
            for k = i + 1 to list_of_nodes
                new_route = two_opt_swap(optimal_route, i, k)
                cost_one = cost(new_route)
                cost_two = cost(optimal_route)
                if cost_one < cost_two
                    optimal_route = new_route
                    continue improving
    return optimal_route
```

## B2: Application of Programming Models
This section does not directly apply to this project any longer. This is due to all the data being stored 
locally within the project itself via the two csv files. 

## B3: Space-Time and Big-O
The runtimes for each major block of code can be found in the comment blocks associated to each block.

The total run time for this project is: `O(n^2)`

## B4: Adaptability
This program should have no problem taking in larger sets of data as it sits right now. The algorithm used 
is fully scalable to accept any size of list. As long as addresses have a corresponding distance to each other
address then any amount of data could be run through the program. 

Of course if the data sets grew exponentially the program would eventually begin to slow down and a more optimized
solution would be a good investment.

## B5: Software Efficiency and Maintainability
This program is efficient because it is able to run in polynomial.

Due to the organization and detailed documentation associated with this program any programmer 
should be able to take this project and enhance or repair as they see fit.

## B6: Self-Adjusting Data Structures
The hash table that stores the package data is the main self-adjusting data structure used in this 
program. This data structure has 4 functions:


`__init__()`
`add()`
`get()`
`_hash_key()`

The `__init__()` function will initialize the data structure using a given size parameter. For this program
I've chosen to have the hash table double in size on creation. The feature of having the hash table double in size
when it's created may need to be revisited in order for the program to scale up.

The data is stored using the `add()` function. This function makes use of the private `_hash_key()` method that will create
a unique index to store an item. This allows for items to be added to the data structure in `O(1)` time. 

The data is accessed using the `get()` function. This function will take the id (index) of the item and use the `_hash_key()`
method to index the items location. This allows for the data structure to access items in `O(1)` time.

By scaling up the size of the structure and having unique ID's the time complexity will remain constant. If the table becomes 
full and item ID's are not unique collisions will occur. Collisions will cause the time complexity of the structure to increase.

## C: Original Code
When running the program from the CLI the initial output will look like this:

## C2: Process and Flow Comments
Please see each major block of code for comments

## D: Data Structure
The data structure used to store package data is a python list made to mimic the 
functionality of a hash table.

## D1: Explanation of Data Structure
The following are the insert and look up functions:

```python
def add(self, key, value):
    """
    adds a package to the list (hash table) if that index is None,
       if that index is not None then that package already exist,
    for this program we are assuming all packages have a unique ID

    :rtype: bool
    :param key: unique ID
    :param value: a package object
    :return: True if added, False otherwise
    """
    hashed_key = self._hash_key(key)
    kvp = [key, value]

    if self.list[hashed_key] is None:
        self.list[hashed_key] = list(kvp)
        return True
    else:  # we have a collision
           print('ERROR: that package id already exist')
        return False
def get(self, key):
    """
    gets a singular package by the ID (key),
    if that ID is None then there is no package there
    :rtype: object
    :param key: unique key
    :return: value associated to key, otherwise False
    """
    try:
        hashed_key = self._hash_key(key)
        kvp = self.list[hashed_key]

        if self.list[hashed_key] is None:
            return False
        else:
            return kvp[1]
    except IndexError:
        return False
```
The `add()` function is meant to take a key (package id) and value (package object).

The `get()` function takes in a package id and returns that package object in `O(1)` time.

This data structure is used to store package objects. This allows for packages to be added and retrieved in constant time.
If a package objects status needs to be updated and the ID is known then that can be done in `O(1)` time. Likewise, if a 
package needs to be added to the table then this can be done in constant time. The only information needed to retrieve a package
from the table is the package ID. If a package is to be added to the table then the ID needs to not already exist in the hash table.

## E: Hash Table
See part D above for the insert function of the hash table. 

Since the hash table takes in an object that is made up of package values the proper way to use this
insert function would be similar to the example below:

```python
...
# use a unique key
key = packaage_id

# construct a package object 
p = Package(package_id, address, city, state, zip_code, delivery_time, weight, status, notes)

# add the key/values to the hash table
hash_table.add(key, p)
...
```

## F: Look-Up Function
See part D for the code behind the look up function.

Since every package id in out program is unique we can use that as our hash key. See the example below
for how the look up function works:

```python
package_id = 1
hash_table.get(package_id)
```

output
```commandline
['1', Package Info - ID: 1, ADDRESS: 195 W Oakland Ave, CITY: Salt Lake City, STATE: UT, ZIP: 84115, ...
         ...   DELIVERY TIME: 10:30 AM, WEIGHT: 21, STATUS: Delivered at 08:14:40, NOTES: ]
```

## G: Interface
The interface for this program is a simple CLI. See section `C: Original Code` for details on 
how this works.

## I1: Strengths of The Chosen Algorithm
The strengths of the 2-opt algorithm are the speed the ability to solve the 
given problem and the ease of implementation. 

With a time complexity of `O(n^2)` it is able to solve the problem in polynomial time.

2-opt is also a known algorithm for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Since this package deliver system is much like the TSP, this algo is a good choice.

Ease of implementation is also strength, the most complex part of the algorithm is
writing a cost function that will work for someones problem.

## I2: Verification of Algorithm
Verification that the algorithm works can be seen above in the provided screenshots 
or by running the program.

## I3: Other Possible Algorithms
Other algorithms to solve this problem could be:
- 3-opt
- Nearest Neighbor
- variation of Dijkstra's

## I3A: Algorithm Differences
#### 3-opt as a potential solution
using 3-opt would also solve the problem at hand and may even produce
a lower total mileage. However, we do then sacrifice time because we would 
then run in `O(n^3)` which is less optimal.

#### Nearest Neighbor (NN) as a potential solution
using NN would provide solution in the same time as 2-opt, however the path
that NN would find would be less optimal than 2-opt. In that case 2-opt is 
a more elegant solution.

## J: Different Approach
If I were to approach this differently I might actually implement more than
one algorithm to solve the problem and use the CLI to choose which one to run
given how large a dataset is. This could help in finding really optimal routes 
for small data sets and decently good routes for really big data sets.

## K1: Verification of Data Structure and Solution
See sections C, D1, E, and F for verification that I am using a hash table
to solve the problem and that my solution solves the problem in under `145` miles.

## K1A: Efficiency
The data being used in the structure is a series of data points that make up a 
package object. Each package object is created and then stored in the hash table using
the package ID as a unique key. Using this unique key the data can then be retrieved from the
hash table in constant time. The unique key translates directly into the index that 
the package is located in the structure. This allows package data points to be accessed 
and updated as the program runs. 

## K1B: Overhead
For handling the data we are able to achieve a constant time complexity
since we have built a hash table. This means retrieval and storage of data
happens in constant time. 

Since this program is run from a local machine the only memory or bandwidth
concerns remain within your local environment.

## K1C: Implications
When scaling the application to work with more packages, trucks, and cities there are many things to consider. 
The underlying data structure will need to become large enough to minimize collisions but not so large that it takes
up unneeded space. Eventually, if the solution is being utilized in other cities with more packages, trucks, etc. then 
moving data to a database should be a consideration. The database could then be shared among all companies while still
being downloaded locally into a hash table for optimizing a route. This data could then be returned to the database with
updated information. 

## K2: Other Data Structures
Two other structures that could be used:
- Priority Queue
- Doubly Linked List

These two structures could be used to store/retrieve package data like the hash table.

## K2A: Data Structures Differences
The Priority Queue (PQ) would slow the retrieval time of grabbing objects in the
end or middle of the list. If data needs to be accessed at any location in a hash table it is most likely retrieved
in constant time. On the other hand, retrieving data from PQ's is usually done from the front of the list. This may cause
a slow down in retrieval if data needed to retrieved from anywhere except the front. 

The Doubly Linked List (DLL) would also slow retrieval time to `O(n)`. DLL's only know what item is before them and after them.
Meaning that in order to retrieve an item from the middle of a DLL we would need to traverse the list from the beginning.
So even if we know the ID of the item in the DLL we don't know what index that item exist at. While in the hash table the 
ID is the key that can be converted into the index of our item.
