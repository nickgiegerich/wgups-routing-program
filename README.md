# Data Structures and Algorithms II â€“ C950
## WGUPS Routing Program
This is a project specified by WGU to solve a package delivery routing problem,
which is essentially the TSP problem. For my solution I implemented the 2-opt 
algorithm, which is a known solution to the TSP that runs in `O(n^2)`.
## Usage
To get the code run this from the command line: 
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/nickgiegerich/wgups-routing-program.git
```

Once that is done, in the main directory where `main.py` is located run:
```commandline
python3 main.py
```

depending on python version^^^

From there you should see the Command Line Interface like this:
```commandline
